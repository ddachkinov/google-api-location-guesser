# Google API location guesser
 A single-file "game", heavily inspired by [Geoguessr](https://geoguessr.com/), using dynamically selected, randomly provided coordinates to select the location, rather than selecting locations from a pre-existing database. Uses Google's Maps and Street View JavaScript APIs.
